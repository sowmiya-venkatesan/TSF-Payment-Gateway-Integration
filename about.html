        <b> Your donation will go where the need is greatest.</b> Help Animals India channels your donations to both well-established and emerging Indian animal protection groups who confront daunting obstacles every day in their mission to rescue, shelter and fight for the rights of animals. We work closely with these groups and vouch for their courage, compassion and determination. Our guidance helps them improve their missions and operations so they can maximize their effectiveness as advocates for and defenders of the animals of India. 

        Your donation will be spread across worthy groups. We're the only American charity that enables donors to contribute to a wide variety of Indian animal protection groups with a single check.
        
        Your donation goes a long way in India. A dollar donated to our partner groups in India, where prices are still very low, can accomplish as much as five or ten dollars donated to charities in developed countries like the United States. If you normally donate $500 a year to charities in the United States or any other developed country, donating even $100 of that to Help Animals India can effectively boost your contribution to the animals to the equivalent of $1000 or more. 
        
        Your donation is tax deductible. Help Animals India is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charitable organization. Your kind donations are U.S. tax deductible (EIN #26-3681514).
        
        Your employer may provide matching funds. Microsoft, Google and others will match employee donations to Help Animals India.
        
        
        
        We don't just provide, we guide. Help Animals India doesn't just write checks to our partner groups in India. We guide them and, in some cases, even nurture young, emerging groups.We help our partner groups improve their missions and operations so they can maximize their effectiveness as advocates and protectors of the animals of India.</p>
